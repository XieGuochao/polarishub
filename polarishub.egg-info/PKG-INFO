        This is a p2p file transfer program via LAN.
        
        This program is implemented with Django Framework. External libraries required: MyQR for generating QR code.
        
        To run the library correctly, you should first create a Python script file to setup polarishub on your computer. In this Python script file, only two lines will be include.
        
        ```python
        from polarishub import setup
        initialization()
        ```
        
        Then run this script file to setup the essential environment for polarishub.
        
        
        
        To run the polarishub on your computer, you should write another Python script file:
        
        ```python
        from polarishub import manage
        runserver(ipAddress, port)
        # here ipAddress and port are default as "0.0.0.0" and "8000"
        # if you want to change them, you should use your own address and port.
        ```
