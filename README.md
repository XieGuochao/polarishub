# polarishub
A p2p file transfer program via LAN.

## Implementation
This program is implemented with Django Framework. No other external libraries are required.

## Usage
1. Before start using it, run setup.py or dist/setup/setup.exe or simply dist/setup.bat to initialize your PolarisHub.
2. Then, you can run *python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000* or simply dist/polarishub.bat to turn on your PolarisHub.
3. You will then generate a server end with the local IP and port 8000 (can be changed manually). Enter localhost:8000 in your Browser to manage your PolarisHub.
4. You can easily share your document with your url or a QR code to your friend. As long as you are under the same LAN, your friend can get access to your documents with high speed.
5. Once you finish sharing, close the console application to shutdown.
